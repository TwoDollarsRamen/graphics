The compiled executable will be placed in the `bin' directory.
A pre-built release executable is placed in the `bin/release'
directory.

The `res' directory must be in the program's working directory
for the program to work properly. It contains all of the textures,
models and fonts for the program to run.

To control the application:
 - Press escape to release the mouse pointer. Left click on the
   window to capture it again.
 - W, A, S, D and the mouse can be used to move the camera around
   when the mouse is captured.
 - When the mouse is note captured, the right click can be used to
   select objects.
 - When an object is selected, W, A, S, D, Left Shift and Left Control
   can be used to move it around. Q and E can be used to rotate it
   around the `y' axis.
 - Window resizing is not supported because I'm lazy and felt like
   just #defining the screen width and height.
